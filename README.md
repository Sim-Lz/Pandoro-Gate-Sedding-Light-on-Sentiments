# Pandoro Gate: Shedding Light on Sentiments
  
  This repository contains a study focused on the **Pandoro Gate** case, which involved the collaboration between Chiara Ferragni and Balocco. The study aims to analyze public sentiment based on comments and reactions to the event, determining whether the general sentiment is for or against Chiara Ferragni and Balocco.
  The objective of this study is to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of comments related to the Pandoro Gate case. The analysis seeks to:
  - Classify the comments as positive or negative.
  - Determine the overall public sentiment regarding Chiara Ferragni and Balocco's collaboration.
  - Identify trends in the sentiment data that might explain public opinion and reactions.

  The data used for this analysis has not been included in this repository in accordance with **privacy** regulations, the **Terms of Service** of the platforms from which it was collected, and to respect the **copyright** of the users who contributed the content.
  
  Although the user comments were collected from public platforms through their respective APIs, they may contain personal or identifiable information, such as usernames and URLs, which cannot be publicly redistributed without explicit consent. Additionally, many of the platforms from which the data was extracted prohibit automated data collection and subsequent sharing of such data in public spaces without authorization.
  For these reasons, the dataset is not made available directly in this repository. However, the structure and analysis methods are described in detail within the code, and you can recreate similar experiments by following the provided instructions.
  
  If you wish to replicate the study, please note that the dataset used in this project consists of comments published on various social platforms and websites, collected through the *official APIs* of each platform.
  Each record in the dataset included the following information:
  - *Source*: the platform from which the comment originated
  - *Username*: the username of the person who posted the comment (not redistributed)
  - *Title*: the title of the article or post to which the comment refers
  - *Text*: the content of the comment
  - *Date*: the date the comment was posted
  - *URL*: the URL of the comment (not redistributed)
  - *Post ID*: the ID of the comment (not redistributed)
  - *Likes*: the number of "Likes" or interactions the comment received

  *Please note that the study was conducted primarily in Italian, and comments posted in other languages were translated accordingly. If you wish to reproduce the analysis in a different language, we recommend exercising caution to ensure that the dataset includes relevant comments on the "Pandoro Gate" case, as such comments are relatively scarce.*
